```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd rfid-attendance
```

2. **Install dependencies**

```bash
npm install
```

3. **Set up environment variables**
Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```bash
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/rfid_attendance"
```

4. **Set up the database**

npx prisma migrate dev --name init

# Seed the database (optional)
npx prisma db seed
```

3. **Set up environment variables**
Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```

5. **Run the application in development mode**

```bash
npm run dev
```

6. **Access the application**
Open your browser at: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

The application automatically redirects to the dashboard: [`/dashboard`](./app/dashboard/page.tsx)

## Database

The system uses PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM. The database schema is defined in [`prisma/schema.prisma`](./prisma/schema.prisma).

For Prisma documentation, visit: [https://www.prisma.io/docs](https://www.prisma.io/docs)

### Viewing the Database Model

You can visualize and interact with your database using Prisma Studio:

```bash
npx prisma studio --config ./prisma.config.mjs
```

This will open Prisma Studio in your browser, allowing you to view and edit data directly from the database.

## REST API

The application exposes a complete REST API. Detailed documentation is available in [`docs/API.md`](docs/API.md).

### Main Endpoints

- `POST /api/scan` - Scan an RFID badge (attendance or registration mode)
- `GET /api/scan` - Retrieve latest registration scan UUID
- `GET /api/persons` - List all persons
- `POST /api/persons` - Create a new person
- `GET /api/persons/[id]` - Get a specific person
- `PUT /api/persons/[id]` - Update a person
- `DELETE /api/persons/[id]` - Delete a person
- `GET /api/attendance` - Get attendance history
- `GET /api/payments?student_id=X` - Get a student's payments
- `POST /api/payments` - Record a payment
- `GET /api/stats` - Get statistics
- `GET /api/reports` - Generate reports
- `GET /api/search` - Search for persons

## Usage

### Scan an RFID Badge

To scan a badge, send a POST request to `/api/scan`:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/scan \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "rfid_uuid": "STU-0001",
    "action": "in"
  }'
```

### Manage Persons

Access the "Persons" tab in the dashboard to:

- Add new persons
- Scan RFID badges when adding persons (click the "Scan" button next to the UUID field)
- Modify existing information
- Delete persons
- Search the list

**Scanning Badges for Registration:**
When adding a new person, click the "Scan" button next to the RFID UUID field. The system will listen for badge scans. When a badge is scanned, the UUID will be automatically populated in the form. The scanner hardware should send POST requests to `/api/scan` with only the `rfid_uuid` field (no `action` parameter) for registration mode.

### Manage Payments

In the "Payments" tab:

- View all students and their payment status
- Record a new payment
- Filter by trimester

### View Statistics

The "Statistics" tab displays:

- Total number of persons by type
- Attendance statistics over a period
- Trend charts
- Top 10 attendance
- Recent activity

### Generate Reports

The "Reports" tab allows you to:

- Filter by date, person type, status
- Export data
- View detailed reports

## Test Data

The system includes automatic test data (seed) that is loaded on first initialization, can be found in [`prisma/seed.ts`](./prisma/seed.ts).

Seed data is defined in `prisma/seed.ts` and can be loaded using `npx prisma db seed`.

## User Interface

The interface is modern and responsive, with:

- **Clean Design**: Clear and intuitive interface
- **Responsive**: Adapted for mobile, tablet, and desktop
- **Light/Dark Theme**: Toggle available
- **Tab Navigation**: Quick access to different sections
- **Interactive Charts**: Visualization of attendance trends

## Available Scripts

```bash
# Development
npm run dev          # Start development server

# Production
npm run build        # Build the application
npm start            # Start production server

# Code Quality

```

## Important Notes

- **Student Access Control**: Students must have paid the current trimester to access
- **Teachers and Staff**: Access always granted
- **Visitors**: Access granted (can be modified as needed)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL via @vercel/postgres for Vercel deployment compatibility
